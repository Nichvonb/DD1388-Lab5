To test the program a main code and a test code was created.
Compile the tests with these instructions as listed and in order of:

*g++ -o lab5_final main.cpp ChessBoard.cpp ChessPiece.cpp King.cpp Queen.cpp Rook.cpp Bishop.cpp Knight.cpp Pawn.cpp
*valgrind --leak-check=full ./lab5_final < tests.in
*g++ -o lab5_tests tests.cpp ChessBoard.cpp ChessPiece.cpp King.cpp Queen.cpp Rook.cpp Bishop.cpp Knight.cpp Pawn.cpp
*valgrind --leak-check=full ./lab5_tests < tests.in

When running the main file it will give you an option to choose what AI each side should have and how the board should look like. Here are a few examples of input:

Exampe 1:

.K..Q...

........

........

...k....

........

........

........

........

Example 2:

.K......

........

..P.....

...k....

....n...

........

........

........

Example 3:

.K......

..N.....

........

...k....

..r.....

........

........

........

This should run all relevant code.
